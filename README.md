# 📌 Pin My Chat

**Pin My Chat** is a simple web app that lets you **save and organize important chat links** — especially useful for ChatGPT users who keep losing that _one brilliant idea_ because there’s no way to pin messages in ChatGPT.

Whether it's a business idea, a game concept, or a cool piece of code — if you can copy the URL, you can pin it here and revisit it anytime.

## 🧠 Why?

ChatGPT doesn't let you pin messages. After a while, important conversations get buried in your history.  
**Pin My Chat** solves that by giving you a space to **save, title, and organize** any link — especially ChatGPT conversations.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 User authentication (Supabase Auth)
- 📌 Save any URL (ChatGPT convos, articles, tools, etc.)
- 🏷️ Add a title or note for context
- 🔍 Search through your pinned items
- 💅 Clean, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
